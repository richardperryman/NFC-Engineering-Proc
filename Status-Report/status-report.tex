\section{Abstract}

This report outlines the work that has been done so far on the Sensor Based Access Control System (SBACS). There are
three main components to the system: the hardware and software that manages the lock units, the server which stores
information about the system, and the software that handles user interations with the server and lock units.

At this time, most of the work on the lock unit technology as well as the server has been completed. The majority of the
remaining work to be done is on the access points, in particular, a web application to run administrative or user tasks
has only been planned.

Aside from this missing element, we are mostly on track compared to our schedule from our initial proposal. We are in
the middle of preliminary integration testing, and intend to have the system fully functional by the end of December.
From there, we can work on refining the design of the system, testing the system, and handling the other course
requirements like the rinal report.
