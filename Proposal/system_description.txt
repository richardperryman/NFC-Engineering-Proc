Lock and Key (Identity?) System.
A system where customers can set up an identity of keys and administrators can set up sufficient identities for locked objects.

Administrators will set up locked objects to accept certain kinds of identities.

Customers will set up identities to be made up of one or more authentication methods, or keys.
The system will store these identities (with the associated authentications).
The system also stores locked objects and their allowable identities.
The system stores contact information for both the customer and the locked object.

Customers can register with the system to use a locked object with a certain identity.

Registrations can send reminders and warnings to the associated contact information for the customer and/or the locked object.
