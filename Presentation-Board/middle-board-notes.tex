Middle top left: What is SBACS?

\begin{itemize}

\item SBACS takes the idea of a keychain and moves it to the cloud
\item Manages many people having access to many locks
\item Generalises the idea of a key to various sensors
%\item Consists of a cloud server, phone application, and some lock hardware

\end{itemize}

Middle top right: Why SBACS?

\begin{itemize}

\item Instead of vulnerable physical keys, SBACS uses secure electronic keys
\item Since your keys are stored on SBACS severs, you can't lose them!
\item Your keys can be easily registered to be able to open any SBACS lock 

\end{itemize}

Middle bottom left: SBACS as a Service

\begin{itemize}

\item A service provider would allow users to easily reuse their keys among many businesses
\item This would also prevent users from having to sign up more than once
\item This would also reduce the cost of hosting SBACS to companies, similarly to cloud computing in general

\end{itemize}
